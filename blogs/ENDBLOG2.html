                <h2>Courses for an Online Psychology Degree</h2>

                <p>Depending on which specific sub-discipline of psychology you&#8217;re most interested in pursuing,
                  your psychology courses may be a little different than those taken by someone else majoring in
                  psychology.</p>
                <p>The online program you choose will also help determine your specific classes, but since many courses
                  are similar, we can give you a basic overview of some of the types of online classes you may be
                  required to take.</p>
                <p>Here&#8217;s a sampling of required courses from Arizona State University&#8217;s online psychology
                  degree program. Wherever you choose to attend school, you&#8217;re probably going to be expected to
                  take similar classes as these.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that while this is a pretty good sample of classes you might be required to take, it
                  certainly isn&#8217;t an exhaustive list.</p>

                <p><strong>Core Education Courses</strong>: Most degrees require basic core classes. These often include
                  English, math, and science. These are basic college classes that most students take.</p>
                <p><strong>Psych 101</strong>: Basic psychology is another common class psychology students take and is
                  an overview of psychology-related topics.</p>
                <p><strong>Intro to Statistics</strong>: This course covers basic statistical concepts, particularly as
                  they can be applied to psychology.</p>
                <p><strong>Research Methods</strong>: Research skills are critical to any good psychologist. The field
                  of psychology is constantly evolving, and new theories are being proven and disproved all the time.
                  Being able to do extensive research can help you stay relevant in the field. This class is designed to
                  teach that skill.</p>
                <p><strong>Reasoning and Critical Thinking</strong>: This class can help you improve your ability to
                  think and reason out complex problems, which can be very beneficial skills for psychologists to have.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Various Upper-Level Classes</strong>: Other classes commonly included are courses on human
                  development, common and rare psychological and neurological diseases, social development,
                  neuroscience, memory and cognition, abnormal psychology, and careers in psychology.</p>
                <p>Together, these classes can help you become a well-rounded student, knowledgeable in various areas of
                  psychology and related disciplines.</p>
                <h2>Bachelorâ€™s of Psychology Degree Salary</h2>

                  average salary to quite high. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average wage for
                  community and social service occupations is $47,520 per year. Licensed psychologists, in general, have
