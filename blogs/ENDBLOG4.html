                <p>
                  Florida is home to some of the world’s longest-standing businesses, professional services, and tourism
                  industries. As a national leader in real estate, tourism, and entertainment, the Sunshine State is a
                  hot destination for people seeking out new business and career opportunities. And with no less than 31
                  schools offering at least one online business degree all over the state, Florida houses some of the
                  greatest online business learning opportunities for potential business leaders on the East Coast. Of
                  course, leaders in business management are valuable everywhere, but they are especially sought after
                  in the largest tropical hubs of the United States: Jacksonville and Miami—metropolises where job
                  opportunities in finance, banking, and tourism often flock for reasons of bounty and diversity.
                </p>
                <h5>Online Learning in Miami</h5>
                <p>
                  The Miami metro area includes the largest grouping of online degree-offering universities in the
                  state. Ten colleges and universities offer online degrees in the Miami metro area. Of those ten, three
                  offer online business degrees: Florida International University, Miami Dade College, and Johnson &
                  Wales – North Miami. Together, these three schools offer 17 degrees ranging from the associate’s to
                  the master’s level, all 100% online and in business. Due to their proximity to the headquarters of
                  some of the largest national and international businesses in the United States, as well as their
                  residence at the hub of one of the largest tourism industries in the world, students who graduate from
                  any of these three colleges or universities will be well positioned to start careers in financial
                  management, tourism and perhaps even their own business in Miami. For those already working in and
                  around Miami and hoping to advance their careers through further schooling, pursuing an online degree
                  at a local school is a flexible and efficient way to qualify for higher-paying jobs, especially with
                  low in-state tuition at a public university.
                </p>
                <h5>
                  Online Learning in Jacksonville
                </h5>
                <p>
                  Jacksonville is the most populous city in the both the State of Florida and the Southeastern United
                  States. It hosts the second-largest grouping of online-degree offering universities in the state. Five
                  traditional four-year universities offer online degrees based in and around Jacksonville. Of those
                  five, only one offers online business degrees: Jones College. Jones College offers 1 associate’s
                  degree and 1 bachelor’s degree, all 100% online and in business. Due to Jones College’s proximity to
                  the headquarters of some of the largest companies in the United States, students who graduate from
                  Jones will be well positioned to start careers in financial management, or even their own business, in
                  Jacksonville and the surrounding area. For those already working in and around Jacksonville and hoping
                  to advance their careers through further schooling, pursuing an online degree at a local school can be
                  a flexible and efficient way to earn a promotion, especially with lower in-state tuition at a public
                  university.
                </p>
                <h5>The 5 Best Online Business Schools in Florida</h5>
                <p>
                  In total, there are 31 online business degree-granting institutions in the state of Florida. These
                  range from community colleges offering affordable associate-level programming and the ability to
                  transfer to a four-year institution, to some of the best graduate business schools in the world. While
                  potential students should first and foremost ensure that a given university has the type of business
                  degree they wish to pursue, there are a few business programs that stand out across the board. We’ve
                  selected our favorite five online business degree-offering universities in business below. To select
                  our programs, we’ve used the methodology of equally weighting the range of online business offerings
                  with the academic prestige of a given university. The academic prestige of universities is calculated
                  using a number of metrics such as average amount of financial need received, average class sizes,
                  admissions standards, and the percentage of faculty holding terminal degrees in their field. Check out
                  our top five online business degree-granting universities in Florida below!
                </p>
